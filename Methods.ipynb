    "Before we started building our k-nn model, we used boxplot to see if there is a significant difference between healthy and sick people's data on each variable based on the overall shift and mean value. Finally, we came to the conclusion that age, exploratory_vessels, oldpeak, and max_heart_rate (4 among the 6) are the most vital predictors to our prediction.\n",

    "Now, we are starting to build our classification model. After splitting the data into 75% and 25% for the training and testing sets respectively, we will do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a knn classification model using k = tune(), and a recipe that uses the 4 parameters mentioned above as predictors on the training set and that scales and centers all the predictors.\n",
    "2. Apply cross-validation on the training data to find the average accuracy from our training set’s prediction using vfold_cv() that folds the data ~5 times. \n",
    "3. Generate a workflow that uses tune_grid to get control over the number of Ks we need, and apply collect_metrics() for plotting.\n",
    "4. Plot K using both geom_point() and geom_line(), and find the K that has the highest accuracy by looking for the peak.\n",
    "5. Rebuild knn model with new k value.\n",
    "6. Pass the new model and recipe into a new workflow using the training set and call fit().\n",
    "7. Predict our classification result by passing the fitted training object and testing set into the predict() as arguments; bind cols if needed. \n",
    "8. Analyze accuracy using metrics and confusion metrics and report the conclusion (the way to visualize the result of our model’s accuracy)"
